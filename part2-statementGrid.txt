    Create now a function that will receive the matrix as first
    parameter, and an array of objects as second parameter. The
    objects contained in the array will specify the position of
    some obstacles.

    Each element of the array will be like the following one:

        {
            x: 2,
            y: 6
        }

    The position specified by the object will be set as 'true'
    in the matrix. For example:

        // We create the grid
        let grid = createGrid(8, 8);

        // We define an array of obstacles
        let obstacles = [
            {x: 2, y: 6},
            {x: 3, y: 1},
            {x: 7, y: 2}
        ];

        // We set the obstacles in the grid
        setObstacles(grid, obstacles);

    After calling the 'setObstacles' function from the example,
    the grid would have the specified positions with 'true' as
    value.

    Once you have created the function, call it after creating
    the grid and put the number of obstacles you want, but with
    the following rules:

        - There must be at least 10 obstacles
        - The function to set obstacles must check for each
          position if it is a valid position (i.e., does not
          exceed the number of rows and/or columns)
